Rooms: dirty and old"
Travello Hotel,muhamad algi,5.0,"Thanks for always helping Mr Roni front office. Helping & food sercive restaurant team. and also the kitchen staff (Mr andhika & Mr Rahmat) met us at the pool, they were very kind and served me, & Very helping from security & valet team. only we need direct access down to the basement without going through the stairs."
Travello Hotel,jessica tanudjaja,5.0,"It was a pleasant to stay at Travello Hotel. I stayed here to attend a wedding located in a five star hotel next to Travello so you can imagine how many things that I brought that time (big dresses, makeup things, shoes, casual outfits, not to mention that I also brought flowers as I was the handbouquet vendor). The most impressive about this hotel is the service. I called the hotel and asked whether I can put my flowers in their chiller prior my arrival, and they were very helpful and let me to stored my flowers in their employee chiller, whilst the hotel where my relatives held her wedding did not allow me to borrow their chiller. Can you imagine how stingy that hotel is, and how generous Travello is, as my relative pay to that hotel and they did not allow me to borrow their chiller, while Travello did not get any money from my relative yet they still being very helpful and let me to store my flowers in their chiller. Travello's location is right before the Terminal, so the traffic jam is still bearable and not long. The hotel room is spacious. My room has a wardrobe located at the edge of the room and looked ""hidden"" but it was actually spacious, and you can simply put your messy things in there so your room still looked neat. The bathroom is so spacious so you do not need to worry to wet the floor when you finish showering since there is a lot of space left. Also you do not need to worry whether you might step on water puddle when you exchange into big dresses. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. When I asked the staff to repair or change my chair (as that chair's spring was broken), they came in a short time and repair my chair. The only setback is the room is not that pristine clean (in my opinion as a very neat person, almost clean freak), the wall is not too thick, and there are no bolster. It is clean though, but not pristine clean. I think the cleanliness will be 7.5/10 for Travello. As for bolster, I can totally understand as there is only a few hotel who has bolsters. Unfortunately, when I stayed at Travello there are a lot of families with children who stayed in the same floor with me and I can hear the children running through the hallway and laughing, so my room quite exposed with the noise from the hallway and from the main road (as my room located in 5th floor). I suggest you to request for higher floors so you might not hear the noise from the main road. I will come back to Travello next time when I visit Bandung. Thank you Travello for your hospitality. In summary: Cleanliness 7.5/10 Service 9.5/10 Friendliness and helpfulness 9.5/10 Location 8.5/10 Room spacious 8.5/10 Noise muffled 7.5/10"
Travello Hotel,Reza Aditya,3.0,"We rent the Suite King room with bathtub. Overall, the room is nice. Spacious and fits our needs. But the bathroom is 3/10. Tidak ada saluran pembuangan di dekat bathtub, jadi air yg tumpah dari bathtub (we bring 2 kids, 8 and 5 years old) selalu tergenang. This is clearly a design fail. My kids constantly tripped because of this! And the elevator. The elevator should be accessible from any floor down to B1 (basement) floor, but it stops at the Lobby and B1 button can't be pressed. You can go up from B1 to any floor, but not the other way around. The steps are steep. This is a nightmare for disable/difable people that stays here, and for seniors over 60. This is friggin' important! The food. Oh my god, this is the first time I order a sunny side up, but tasted gross! Other food is so so. Not that good, but not that bad either. The pool, meh, small. Clearly, this hotel can be better. The location, services from the staffs, and room are nice. But not the facility. Please improve. That's why I gave only 3 out of 5 stars (should be 2 out of 5, but I'm being nice). Price wise, it's cheap. The price is really good."
Travello Hotel,Jessie Jess,5.0,"Excellent in everything! Huge and luxurious lobby, humble and helpful staffs, clean room. Really worth the money even though the location is quite far from city. Will definitely come back!"
Travello Hotel,abyaz Fazl,5.0,"Good hotel for group , work and vacation . Price reasonable for this hotel"
Travello Hotel,B Harsanto,5.0,"recommend hotel with clean rooms, friendly staff, a varied breakfast menu"
Travello Hotel,Citra Novi,5.0,"stay in suite room early 2020, the room was huge, bathroom also big with spacious bathtub, the hotel was clean, hand sanitizer everywhere to keep the hygiene. pool was clean, not too big though. selection and taste of breakfast was okay. the laundry package consider cheap, with great quality. totally recommended place to stay."
Travello Hotel,Srisna J. Lahay,5.0,"Great hotel. Strategically situated on a road leading to lembang & across from universitas pendidikan indonesia (UPI), so close to city center & tourist destinations. Large room. Clean. Great service. Amazing view of bandung landscape. We stayed on the 8th floor & had this beautiful sunrise from our window room. Price? Not too expensive. But worth every cent if u consider the location & the view u get üòéüôè"
Travello Hotel,Decy Sophan,3.0,"The Breakfast is average, the vibes is not so good, but if you just want to stay for 1 day while you're visiting bandung, is good choice, near UPI, the education university of Indonesia."
Travello Hotel,Nurul Akbar Syakur,3.0,"We stay for 2 nights and here are my reviews: Pros: 1. The breakfast is tasty 2. The lobby's setting is great 3. easy to park a car in the basement 4. All the staffs are friendly 5. Quiet place. good for the family 6. Stroller-friendly environment 7. High chair available in the restaurant Cons: 1. Not enough lights in the room 2. The room's setting is average 3. Smokers are allowed to smoke in the restaurant during breakfast, although separate section, the people inside could smell it. Not recommended for those who bring children 4. Swimming pool is too small 5. The hot water is not that hot"
Travello Hotel,RAHANDI BUDIMAN,5.0,Simple and nice hotel with complete facility
Travello Hotel,AldriansyahD,4.0,Modern style. Lobby concept and ambience is very good. Make you dont want to leave it. Room is comfy and the concept is also nice. Has a sofa with large window behind it. View in the morning from room is great. Breakfast is ok. There's a small pool after restaurant. The hotel also have a bar in rooftop.
Travello Hotel,Mariska Szabo,3.0,"A great hotel to stay in the Setiabudi area of Bandung. Very modern and sleek. The rooms are relatively big, and the shower room's size is quite acceptable as well. The hot water isn't that hot though, which is a bit disappointing considering Bandung's weather. Also, the breakfast is quite lacking in terms of protein availability. And for some weird reason, the elevator doesn't go until the basement level. Another warning I should mention is the basement parking area; the entrance is extremely steep - try to park your car near the lobby instead."
Travello Hotel,Ichsan Rahmany,4.0,"Decent four star hotel with basic facilities, a great view and tiny swimming pool. Need to be extra mindful of the bedsheets as we found ours had some stains in it. And we had to request a make over. The toiletries we also below standard, with the shampoo smelling something like fabric detergent. Had to buy my own shampoo cause the hotel shampoo caused hair fall. Breakfast service starts at 6:00, however, we found that the egg station was manned at 7:30, and by that time the dining area was too crowded. For dinner we ordered room service, but for some reason the operator gave us the wrong pricing (before taxes) that caused a mild confusion. Need to improve some areas of it's services."
Travello Hotel,Darmawan Said,5.0,Nice hotel. Near to many famous destination in Lembang and Dago. Recommended if you will to go to some place in Lembang and Dago.
Travello Hotel,Mudy S,4.0,"Nice hotel, spacy rooms, not optimized for business travelers. Clean and smooth as stars hotel. Starbucks just next door. Great for meetings and venues. There's a very small swimming pool. Bathroom shower is very low pressure. One of the best around Setiabudi road."
Travello Hotel,The Cloud89,5.0,"Visited this hotel for the first time. The room was really clean and cozy. A hotel with modern design which make feel so comfortable. Room facility was quite complete. They are having nice staff, very polite and friendly. Very impressive with food menu for breakfast, variety of foods were many and all of them were have good taste. Nice experience stayed in this hotel. Hope to go back here someday."
Travello Hotel,Vikas Tyagi,3.0,"The hotel was good, bad over all experience because of the way reservation was handled. We booked room with children's and were given a room just with a single king bed. We also had booked with breakfast option and we were forced to pay extra for kids breakfast. So basically we paid full and got charged again."
Travello Hotel,Intan Farida,3.0,"The staff is friendly and helpful. The access to basement is by walk only, make it difficult to carry luggages. The room is clean and comfortable although it will be more convenient if the put a carpet or a rug on the floor. The sofa could be bigger in deluxe room."
Travello Hotel,Rifa'atul Maulidah,4.0,"Near to UPI campus, quiet and comfortable for your business trip"
Travello Hotel,Anita Agustina,1.0,"The room is dirty, there was a dot of blood in our bedcover, and the sheet seems to be dirty as well. It claims to be a non smoking hotel but our room had cigarette smokes real bad. We had to switch rooms two times to finally get at least a less smelly one. Breakfast was just okay even though some of the food taste bare."
Travello Hotel,roy primera,3.0,"I stayed at the hotel for a business meeting. The hotel is quite far from city center so I would not suggest staying there if you are on a business trip except other activities are to be done around the area. A cozy hotel for business meeting and vacations. The bed is ok, but the room lighting was not bright enough to work. Amenities are up to standard. Buffet Breakfast was included and many selections were available. Make sure you order double or triple eggs because their standard is only one egg per person for breakfast. The coffee shop closed early at 11pm. The road outside the hotel has no pedestrian walk, be very careful when walking around outside to get coffee or shopping. Its a fast lane with fast vehicles, very scary to walk on the road. Overall the hotel is ok, but since the room lighting is too dark I might put this hotel as an alternative place to stay only while traveling to Bandung."
Travello Hotel,I Wayan Adisaputra,5.0,"Sorry for my late review. I was staying here for 2 nights at end of January 2019 for a short business-leisure trip to Bandung. Booked 2 standard rooms for my family at that time. I was arrive on Thursday and the hotel was very quiet at the time. It wasn't holiday season and during weekday time, so its pretty much normal for hotel in touristy area like Bandung for having lower occupancy at the time like that. And actually I like it when the hotel is not fully crowded by guest, you can enjoy the hotel more privately although its probably not good for the hotel business.. hahaha.. And here is the summary of my stay here. Pros: - This hotel already took my attention for a while, couple of times passing by, the building facade always attract me. You can also see from the picture in internet and instagram that Travello Hotel has a nice design inside, and yes it has great lobby with very high ceiling, a lot of sofa and lounger to relax or wait for check-in/out process. Its quite instagramable lobby to take a couple of shot here (check some on instagram @rheta.the.traveler.baby). - I was arrive early at that time so to spend time waiting for the room to be ready, we took a quick lunch beside their pool in the ground floor (same floor as lobby) and the F&B prices is very reasonable and not expensive for a 4-star hotel. Food taste and portion also pretty good. - Location wise actually depend on your purpose of stay. If you're planning to spend moat of your time on north Bandung area or Lembang, it is a great choice of place to stay. Very close to Terminal Ledeng (less than a km) its situated right on the entrance to Lembang area. Also near to UPI and setiabudhi area where FO and restaurant located. But if your activity mostly in the Bandung city center or Dago area, staying in this hotel especially on holiday season could be tricky. Most of the time the road in front of the hotel (Jl.Setiabudhi) that going up to Lembang is jammed with traffic although the other direction is pretty empty. You can easily leave the hotel and going south to Bandung City Center or Dago or Cihampelas area, but going back is totally different case. - Room has spectacular view especially on high floor (I always recommend to get high floor room when you stay in a hotel, its offer better view most of the time). You can see Bandung city landscape from above or looking the mountainous north Bandung area depend on your side of the room. Both are spectacular view to have from your bedroom window. - I put high scores on hotel's room that has proper working space and Travello Hotel has it. Proper working chair and table is a must in my opinion on this era of digital nomad and online working. - Pretty large bedroom size and very large bathroom also a plus points here. - There are basement and outdoor parking available. Total could be be covering maybe around 15-20 cars at maximum. Pretty decent parking capacity for hotel in Bandung. Parking space is a big concern when you are choosing hotel in Bandung as most of the hotel has very limited parking space. - At the beginning because I found the hotel was very quiet at the time and not so many guest staying, I thought the breakfast will be served in ala carte style. Turnout I was wrong because it still served in buffet (and I loves buffet). - Very attentive staff especially Mbak Ayu (actually I kind of forgot the names, so sorry Mbak) the Marketing Communication of the hotel that say hello to us during breakfast and asking if we have any comment or suggestion for our stay. Great hospitality and communication to make sure all the needs of the guest are satisfied. - They have small pool on the ground floor right beside the restaurant and it has great view facing the northern Bandung. Not the best one but still great to see the mountainous slope of northern Bandung. Check my Tripadvisor for the complete review as Google Maps has limited space for full review."
Travello Hotel,Ferona Hillary,2.0,"Not worth it for 4 star hotel.. :) dirty,bad smell for the bedroom n if u staycation on sunday the kitchen was close from 5pm"
Travello Hotel,Fery Kastanja,1.0,"I take 2 rooms. I get twin bed for both. When i ask to Front desk agent to joined our bed ,i found under the bed is very dirty and there is trash under the bed.

That's why i give your hotel rate with one star.."

Travello Hotel,Peter Tyson,2.0,"This place is a bit weird! Firstly, the non-smoking rooms our group asked for smelt of stale smoke to varying degrees. Even the towels had a bit of a stale smoke smell to them - not overpowering, but annoying. Oh, the towels appeared a bit grimy and the floors had clearly been vacuumed but never moped. Second, the room service experience we had was strange! My chicken steak arrived without a knife and my son‚Äôs bolognaise was sweet. The server tried to get us to pay for the food then and there - cash - which I didn‚Äôt have to hand as my wife was out with the rest of our family. Eventaully the server gave up - language difficulties being part of the reason why. It seemed impossible to charge the meals to the room. Later on - at midnight - we got a phone call (waking us up) from the restaurant that my wife took. They were asking for payment on the room service as they were closing up! My wife told them that our money was in her parent‚Äôs room, but they were pretty persistent in expecting paymen then and there. She got them to give up after asking whether they wanted her to go wake her parents up to get to the money! Finally, at 8.30 we had a phone call asking if we would be down for breakfast. Not sure what to think of that one except it‚Äôs a little bit odd. Fitout of the hotel is fine, but it seems the systems and quality control just aren‚Äôt there. And if our room was any smokier it would change the experience from a bit odd to quite unpleasant."

Capsule Bali,Holly Parkinson,5.0,"My favourite hostel I've stayed. So much fun, something going on every day. If you love to party this is the place hands down. Really gorgeous rooms, comfy beds and lovely common areas, always so clean. The staff are fantastic too and the food is absolutely delicious. Location is brilliant, a 3-5 min walk to the main bars. Honestly such a good place, loved it!!"
Capsule Bali,Abby Barnes,3.0,"Stayed in the hostel for 4 nights. Great hostel and comfy beds. Only down side was you cannot relax downstairs as there‚Äôs karaoke going on almost every night. It was very loud Also, the pool turned my blonde hair bright GREEN!!"
Capsule Bali,Emma Rouse,1.0,"Do not stay here someone DROWNED. The staff don‚Äôt care about guest safety. I was staying here with friends and a guest drowned in their pool during the pool party were binge drinking is encouraged. My friends saw him go down and immediately were trying to alert staff and go down to find him, however there is a really deep end, due to the diving board, and you can‚Äôt see the bottom, making this very difficult. Despite being told, the staff brushed my friends off and claimed they were just seeing things, after alerting more staff it took them at least half an hour for someone else to help and eventually find and bring up the body and chaos ensued with other guests doing cpr. A very traumatic experience dealt with horribly by the staff and a man is now dead. Another night a man tried to get into my friends bed whilst she was sleeping and when questioned about it in the morning claimed to be drunk and didn‚Äôt remember. The hostel were informed but stated that they couldn‚Äôt kick him out as he was a paying customer, disgusting."
Capsule Bali,Raghvi Khatri,1.0,"This is most terrifying place to live in. The staff do not care about their guest safety. All they care about throwing partying, and binge drinking. On the second night of our stay- a guy drowned in the pool and died. when my friends informed the staff , they ignored it by saying it‚Äôs a ghost and we should have fun in Bali. There are no lights in the deep swimming pool and no staff is assigned to keep a look at the pool whilst hosting a pool party. The staff were not properly trained on how to handle a situation like that. It took them 10 mins to actually call an ambulance and the ambulance never arrived. he was long gone due their ignorance. The guest were trying to the cpr. AND on the first night a supposedly drunk guy tried to get into my friends bed and were watching her sleep. When we complained about it to the reception , the staff said that manager is offering free drinks and food to us as a bribe but they will not take any action against the guy. Do your mental health a favour and don‚Äôt stay here."
Capsule Bali,Amelia Chisholm,1.0,"Somebody drowned and died in the swimming pool! Myself and my friends were supposed to spend 2 nights at this hostel but left on our second evening after a man drowned during the pool party whilst staff members were partying and doing balloons. We saw the man drown and immediately informed staff members after one of us tried to swim to the bottom of the pool to save him but couldn‚Äôt find him. The first staff member ignored what we were telling him and walked away. The second didn‚Äôt seem to believe us and after shining her torch at the pool for a couple of seconds walked away too. Another staff member told us that the man we saw drown was probably a ghost and that it‚Äôs normal to see these things in Bali. After 30 minutes, one man swam to the bottom of the pool and found the man‚Äôs body. Staff members refused to call an ambulance and did nothing to help, as other guests ran to get a defibrillator and attempted to resuscitate him but it was too late. Their dorms are also mixed and have no locks so on our first night one of us woke up to a random man trying to climb into her bed at 4am. Don‚Äôt stay here. The staff don‚Äôt care about guest safety and are putting people in danger."
Capsule Bali,Daniel Thompson,5.0,Very good place to stay! Good place to events and socialize!!Staff is really good and helpfull the drinks and food are delliciousSo recomended to stay here and enjoy the party in the hostel
Capsule Bali,Lauren Cheesman,1.0,"This place needs to be SHUT DOWN!! During my two night stay here (which ended up becoming one night) a boy DROWNED and DIED in the pool during the 'pool party' on the 13th Dec. We saw him go under and my friend tried searching the insanely deep pool (which has no lights in it, for a start!!). For OVER 30 minutes we alerted 5 or more different members of staff!!! telling them that someone was at the bottom of the pool drowning and that they need to get a lifeguard in there or drain the pool or do something!!. We were completely ignored for no valid reason, with one staff member even going as far as to gaslight us saying 'it's bali haha you might have seen a ghost'. Because of the disgusting ignorance of this hostel's staff and management an SOMEONE IS DEAD. After 30 minutes of trying to get staff to listen to us someone jumped in and eventually found the body. It took THIRTY (30) MINUTES!!!!! Not only does mycapsulebali encourage binge drinking, balloon-taking and swimming at the same time during their 'karaoke' and 'pool parties' etc. but they have no staff members trained in cpr or lifeguarduarding. There isn't so much as a protocol for when a guest tells someone that 'there's someone drowning in the pool'. Instead, you are ignored. When the body was taken out of the water the staff literally did nothing!! I wish I was joking it was honestly the most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed and has caused me to question my faith in humanity. 3 or 4 different GUESTS attempted cpr whilst other GUESTS screamed at staff to call an ambulance, an ambulance that never even turned up. Since this tragic incident, my friends have visited the Balinese police in order to give a statement and open up an investigation but were essentially laughed by said police. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN. Please, I beg you, do not book a stay at this vile establishment!!!!!!! Doing so would only support heartless, money-hungry individuals whose ignorance is to blame for a preventable death."
Capsule Bali,Gede Oka,5.0,"This is my first time stay at a hostel and makesme feel in love with the foods they cook,the place is clean and recommended."
Capsule Bali,Emma Voisei,1.0,"Very unclean:( The bedding seemed okay the first night I stayed but after returning to the hostel on the second day there was a horrible smell. I realised after seeing the sheets came away from the bed that the mattress was almost black it was so dirty!! And the sheet were covered in yellow and brown stains!! After asking staff for new bedding, they told me I could change beds and AGAIN the bedding was covered in yellow and brown stains and smelt soo badly of dampüò≠ I think it was the air conditioning causing all the damp in the room and my friend also got quite a sore throat from this as well. :/ Also, according to the sign on the wall, if you have your period and bleed on the sheet you have to buy the sheets (i think this is an absolutely disgusting rule to have) Was very sad as the staff actually seemed very friendly and the other facilities (pool, bar etc) are good and seems a great place to party if you‚Äôre into that!"
Capsule Bali,Esme Norman,5.0,Definitely a party hostel. Great way of meeting people. The staff are lovely and the beds are comfortable.
Capsule Bali,Shubham Saxena,2.0,"It was a below average stay overall. We checked in late around 2am, the bar guy asked for our passports so that we don't leave without paying until morning when reception opens at 6am. We mentioned, we are good to pay the entire money in deposit, but they were definitely not okay with it. The place where they were about to keep the passport was a simple unlocked drawer. Didn't feel welcomed at all. We had to sleep outside by the pool in mosquitoes. The rooms had bad AC, we were sweating a lot at night. Bathroom have no latches. Might be good, if you checkin during normal times. Update after below review: Our flight got delayed and had to face this, even after confirmation over email (chat with Dewi) that we'll reach late. They didn't tell us they'd want to keep our passports as a ""security deposit"". Now, it definitely feels rude. Regarding the AC problem, everyone else was sleeping without bedsheet as well. We had 4 friends staying together. Everyone felt the same. To the owner- please be open to feedback, reviews are personal experience reviews. ü§ò"
Capsule Bali,Peter,1.0,Guest drowned in pool & hotel staff did nothing to stop. There is something seriously wrong with the management of this place. Please do not support this business.
Capsule Bali,Sharelle Taylor,5.0,"One of my fav hostels in bali so far. The pool area is lovely to chill in the day and the events are amazing. We joined the Thursday bbq with free flow drinks, karaoke and tattos and it was SO fun! Despite the party atmosphere I've managed to sleep without issues. I think some of the showers could do with replacing."
Capsule Bali,Jason Bedford,5.0,"Great place to stay in the heart of Seminyak especially if you're new to Bali or the area it is very easy to get to any place whether it's the beach, night life, local markets or any of the surrounding areas like legian, Kuta and canggu. If you're into parties and a starting point to get to know other travellers they have it covered. If you need tours booked they have it covered. Plus you can easily stay in the comfortable individual pods in the mixed dorms or female only dorms but also have a selection of private rooms. Pools, parties, drinks Bar and tours are all here. Special thanks to the legends Arta and Devi for being awesome during the stay ü§ôüèΩ"
Capsule Bali,Julie Ponhong,5.0,"We spent 8 nights in this hostel, such a nice vibe, pool area is cozy and chill with good music all day. Always people chilling in the afternoon and evening, just good vibes here. Also cool dorms with LED lights :DDD"

Capsule Bali,Celena M,5.0,"One of the cleanest and coolest hostels I've stayed at. Loved the beds, very smart lighting. Great space to relax and watch a movie. 15 minute walk to beach clubs. Fairly social at night as well! Really adore the owner, he was very kind and gave us a lot of advice for our future travels in Bali. The little gift they leave you with is also really sweet, don't make you feel like just another backpacking strolling through from start to finish. Would go back again :)"

Capsule Bali,junixyz,5.0,"Best hostel I've ever stayed in, comfy beds, 2 pillows, own plug, table and lamp all in your own private pod, massive lockers with coded locks for security, all this and the air con is on point! Amazing social communal areas, beautiful rooftop terrace for ultimate chilling. Cheap beer, great food free water and great bathroom. The staff are friendly and efficient, & always have a smile! I love Rara. Honestly the best place I've stayed, so great we're now on our 3rd visit!! couldn't recommend more."
Capsule Bali,Rebecca Josephine,4.0,"Needed to move rooms as the door lock was broken and then bathroom had no loo roll. Otherwise nice pool, great good and kind staff"
Capsule Bali,Abby Myers,5.0,"I love this hostel! We stayed for a week and came away with so many great memories. It's the perfect spot to meet other backpackers and make friends! The beds are extremely comfortable and the staff is beyond helpful! It's very clean and safe with large lockers under each bed. The wifi doesn't always work, but that doesn't really seem so important when there's so much else to do! It's about a 20 minute walk to the beach and located next to the most delicious cafe. If I'm ever in Seminyak again I will definitely stay here again!"
Capsule Bali,Vicki L,1.0,"Had an awful experience at this hostel. It's definitely great for meeting people and partying, but facilities were not clean, it's loud until the crack of dawn, and showers were always so cold. The tours they offered were extremely overpriced, you can find better deals elsewhere. The beds were old foam mattresses that were falling apart and mine was infested with ticks (I was bitten on my legs). They almost lost my laundry which is not the staffs fault, but the laundry service they used and I lost hours of my time retrieving it. The only good thing was the food was good and prices were decent. Would not stay here again."

Capsule Bali,Sam Regan,5.0,"Vibrant hotel with clean and modern rooms. Staff went above and beyond to accommodate me in a difficult situation, would definitely stay again"
Capsule Bali,Lucas Moreira,1.0,"Worst experience I've ever had in a hostel. The place is dirty, the mattresses are old (I even found a rusty earring right below my sheet, just proving that it hasn't been replaced - please see photo attached and just check the color of the mattress), room floor covered by pringles, people having sex at 4am even with a staff member sleeping in the same room and asking for silence, dirty bathroom, and so on. I'm really glad I've booked only 1 day after reading the reviews and could move right after waking up without any major issues (I really wanted to give this place a chance). Wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you are looking for a party hostel and you don't give a **** for a decent place."
Capsule Bali,Lynson Saint Preux,5.0,Best party hostel in Seminyak if not in all of Bali! From the moment I walked in I knew it was going be a good time. Ngurah (Rah Rah) was amazing and helped me book the rest of my trip with ease. The guys behind the bar know how to get you drunk in a hurry. Shout out to the manager Nico for booking epic trips for the whole hostel to vibe out to. Great spot to be if you're not an uptight a**hole. Amazing experience all around!
Capsule Bali,Rosie,2.0,"The rooms are gross, they smelt really bad and the capsule itself was quite dirty - I found a toenail and a used contact lens under the mattress. The pool looked like it hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in a long time and I didn‚Äôt witness anyone actually using it because it was so gross. My locker broke meaning that I couldn‚Äôt open it get my bag out and had to wait for a technician to fix it. My shoes were also stolen from the shoe rack just outside my room. On the whole the staff were friendly and helpful and the food was actually decent. The social side of things made our stay way better, I think most of the good reviews must be fake though because this hostel is sooo highly rated which is just not accurate, the pictures definitely make it look a lot nicer than in real life."
Capsule Bali,Alana Smith,5.0,"It's the best hostel in Bali!!! They have free dinner & free shot almost every night,I love the capsule bed ,it's so comfy ,they have huge locker to secure all of my stuff. And of course Mango the lady who's helping me a the time. Definitely recommend this place if you are a party animal."

Capsule Bali,Vanessa Chan,5.0,"I had an amazing stay with this hostel. The staff are great with giving you advice about tours, transport and local knowledge of Indonesia. This hostel is very social which was great as I am a solo traveller, they also provide fun tours to get everyone to meet each other. The hostel is very modern and the owners have thought of everything from chill out movie areas to the bar and again in the rooms to the soft mattresses. I would stay here again. Rara is my fav!"
Capsule Bali,Richard Dawkins Audrey,5.0,My favorite hostel ever! It was a little bit hard to find because the name is different on the sign. The facilities are incredible. The beds were so clean and comfortable. The movie room was a great place to meet new people. Overall the atomosphere made it an amazing experience. It was a little bit of a walk from the main area of Seminyak but it never felt too far. Definitely walking distance from Potato Head and the beach.. Find Rara he is very helpful.
Capsule Bali,Frida R√∂bel Thorsson,5.0,Very good place!!!! Sooo good and fresh! And very friendly
Capsule Bali,E Ralph X,1.0,"Definitely a party hostel. The music is in full swing from around 11am til gone 2am, and the eating/seating area is sociable. Drinks are cheap, food is cheap and enjoyable. If you are in Bali to party recklessly and nothing else, then you will be fine. ""Lockable"" cubbyholes for your luggage are temperamental and the staff will happily reset your code without needing any proof that it is your cubbyhole. Just saying. Showers are disgusting and have the water pressure that resembles a dribbling dog; showering in flip flops is a must. It is worth noting that in my 3 night stay, I had around 12 different dorm-mates, and not once were the duvet covers changed. Yes, the bottom sheets and pillowcases were changed (and they look exhausted and old), but the DUVET COVERS WERE NEVER EVER CHANGED. EVER. I have slept in many hostels. This is the one time I've slept, fully clothed, on top of the duvet - with a blanket on top of it. So, if you want to sleep in a bed that's seen plenty of action with a duvet that's never seen a washing machine, then I recommend the hostel."
Capsule Bali,Nora Cooper-Farsang,5.0,"Awesome place to stay! Staff are awesome, friendly and the food is the best. Beds are okay, the capsule idea is good for privacy but it gets messy fast and the room itself isn‚Äôt too clean. Would definitely recommend for a few nights to party and enjoy the nightlife of seminyak."
Capsule Bali,rgoodenough1,5.0,"Stayed there for a week in September I was in the dorm which was extremely cheap and had a lockable locker. The atmosphere is brilliant full of energy and they love to party there. Staff were fantastic, fun and helpful, at the time I had broken my foot and they really tried to help with everything. Would and will go again!"
Capsule Bali,Deniz Aytac,5.0,"Best hostel in Seminyak. It's fun to stay here, you always meet cool people from everywhere in the world. After eating something from the cooks inside the hostel, it will be hard to find something better for the buck anywhere else in Bali. The personnel especially the management is always nice and helpful with every problem you have. Definitely an recommendation!!"
Capsule Bali,MX Kerry Chia,1.0,"Extremely disappointed by capsule - we had a private room and it was never cleaned; we found a dirty pair of slippers under the bed; and on our first night a man (supposedly from housekeeping) with a key card barged into our room without knocking, when my friend & I were getting changed. Worst of all, capsule messed up our ferry booking, and gave our ferry spots to other people when we‚Äôd paid for them in advance and woke up at 5AM for it, effectively wasting an entire day of our holiday while we waited for the next one. The pool was also absolutely filthy while we were there, turning into an ominous shade of brown at its worst - you couldn‚Äôt see the bottom of the pool, nor could you have paid me to swim in it. The noise goes on into the wee hours of the morning, and it‚Äôs impossible to get any sleep even on the upper floors and in private rooms. The lack of mirrors in the room / toilet was also extremely inconvenient. I‚Äôve stayed in some seriously amazing hostels around the world and this unfortunately comes nowhere close. There are loads of great options in Bali and I definitely won‚Äôt be coming back."
Capsule Bali,Jshsh Jwjsjs,5.0,"I would stay here again when am comeback to Bali. They have amazing hostel clean, social, all of they worker or staf are so half-full and nice . Bar so fantastic and you so social and easy to meet some traveller. And special for Herman you are amazing bartender."
Capsule Bali,William Heap,5.0,"Capsule is a hostel that offers a variety of good experiences! From the moment me and my friends arrived we knew the vibe was right here. A safe comfortable environment. Great food, music (you can be the dj yourself), atmosphere and rooms. Devi in particular was the most welcoming here. She helped me when i had an issue with my room."
Capsule Bali,Li La,4.0,"My first stay was awefull as it's a party hostel and the rooms weren't really clean - empty plastic bottles laying around etc. On my second stay for only one night before my flight it changed a lot and the management even asked me why I gave them a bad review the last time, telling me they'd do everything they can to make this stay better and I should always come forward if something's wrong. The electronic lock to my locker was broken so I told the reception and within 10 minutes the problem was solved. The room was much cleaner than before and the staff more helpfull. Well done!"
Capsule Bali,Stef,5.0,Very good place to stay! Good place to party and socialize!! Staff is really good and helpfull the drinks and food are dellicious So recomended to stay here and enjoy the party in the hostel PS: this is a party hostel
Capsule Bali,Sahil Essani,5.0,"The hostel is amazing in terms of cleanliness and space. It's got a great vibe not only in terms of the space but also the people. It's really easy to socialize as a solo traveler. The team including Rara, Mango, Tim, oscar and the rest of the guys are fantastic and go above and beyond in helping you with anything. Great job. Cheers!"
Capsule Bali,Tim Wilson,5.0,"Amazing hostel, best in seminyak and surrounding areas. Staff and facilities are amazing. Capsule pod beds are comfortable and the rooms are nice air conditioned. Bar and pool to chill at during the day and extremely social whether it is high or low season! Highly recommend!!!"
Capsule Bali,Daniel Roberts,5.0,Booked as our first stop because fairly close to the airport. Ended up staying for 5 nights because of the atmosphere of the place; great place to meet people and the staff are amazing. Not the cheapest but the rooms are clean and have the most comfortable beds I've slept in any Bali hostel
Capsule Bali,M√•ns Axelsson,4.0,A really nice hostel. Clean and the capsule are great! Keep in mind it is a party hostel. They have arule that it should be quiet at 11 but they don't follow it. But if you fine with that I can really recommend it!
Capsule Bali,dot sum,5.0,"I love this hostel. I stayed here 2 times. Supercomfy and clean beds. The staff are amazing, especially for ""MADE"" , i will be back :) The hostel itself is in a good location, a close walk to the restaurants,shops and beach in seminyak and a short taxi ride to kuta or canggu. The atmosphere here is also really nice. This is one of the best hostels i've stayed in, 5 stars class for this hostel !!!"
Capsule Bali,Lara ‚ÄúWonder & Wander‚Äù,1.0,Had to leave and go to another hotel pretty quickly. It‚Äôs evident through my experience and everyone else‚Äôs review that they don‚Äôt even change the sheets on the bed - there were stains everywhere. I know it‚Äôs a hostel but I‚Äôve stayed at many that have found balance between party and cleanliness and this wasn‚Äôt one of them. I had booked private room as well.
Capsule Bali,Cory Jackson,1.0,"The only plus is the bar. Outside of that, the staff don't do anything to quieten people after 11 - my room was downstairs, next to reception and leading right onto the main social area, and people were still partying til 4am, loudly. They cancelled my booking on a simple technicality too, without contacting me to inform me. This is a bad hostel for first time travellers."
Capsule Bali,Tjong Sentjoen,5.0,Really good for people travelling with budget .Its hostel with 10 capsules(bunker beds) in one room. Each floor has two rooms .you can even get bike on rent from there Their rates are probably lowest in Bali .Roof top sitting arrangement is also there. Place is neat and clean. My fav is Rara
Capsule Bali,Matt Robinson,5.0,"Easily the best hostel in bali! And I have been to bali over 15 times staying at different hostels and cheap hotels. First, the beds are very high quality and really comfortable. And the capsule dorm rooms are spotlessly clean and quite fun. You actually have a lot of privacy! The staff are really great and became friends of mine and genuinely want to help in any way they can. And last but not least the social vibe is the best of any hostel I have been to. Just sit down at the big table and you will meet a load of new people. Why more hostels don't have this setup is crazy. Great location too. I booked one night to check it out and stayed an entire month haha."
Capsule Bali,Ben Roache,4.0,"Cool decor, good beds, and capable staff. But a little noisy in the evenings and the mornings when trying to sleep.Not technically a party hostel, but let's be honest, it is Bali. And taxi drivers don't know where it is, which is a little frustrating sometimes. But"
Capsule Bali,MC,5.0,"TOP NOTCH !!! The room is perfect, impeccably clean ,comfortable and well maintained, the bathroom is clean, Staff very good and the food its so yummy and cheap. try their brunch ! And join their Pool Party : All you can drink!! Definitely Will be Back!"
Capsule Bali,Muhammad Jatash,5.0,"√çve been traveling and living in hostels/hotels for nearly 4 years and I can say without hesitation that this hostel is one of the best of all that Ive ever visited. The location is perfect The staff are fun, friendly, and knowledgable but they were so amazing that it was make me hard to leave. I will truly miss every one of you If you don't stay here in BALI you are missing out the Best Hostel! Thanks Rara"
Capsule Bali,Iker Uranga,5.0,"This place is of the walls! We had so much fun staying here. Tons of cool people ready to socialize, super friendly staff, cheap drinks, a killer pool, and mega comfy beds. 10/10 would recommend"
Capsule Bali,Luuk M,5.0,"Very nice people and really great accomodation. Everything is really clean and new, perfect place for backpackers whether you're travelling with friends or alone. Staff is also the best and willing to help you out with anything. Would definitely recommend it!"
Capsule Bali,Nawaf Yousuf,2.0,"Booked the Deluxe 6 bed room ensuite. Really poor place to stay! The beds were wobbly, barely had space to sleep on the beds as there were no capsules in the so called deluxe room. The room was not clean at all it seemed they just changed the sheets and thats it. You cant walk bare feet as dirts sticks on your feet. Worse part: Lockers are a joke! You can barely put your passport in them! I had to carry my stuff every where I went. Only good thing is the atmosphere."
Capsule Bali,David D. Tan,1.0,"The rating is about the different tours they offer. I booked the sunrise tour at Mt-Batur and it was the worst experience I had in Bali. Also after pointing that at the reception, they actually didn't care. Otherwise the hostel is fun and the food respectable."
Capsule Bali,Nina Haaland,1.0,"Very friendly staff! If you want to party all day&night and dont mind that everyone is hammered, this is the place to be. Prob the best party hostel in Seminyak! If not, dont stay here. The 6bed-dorm we slept in had tiny lockers and just a small area for our luggage. My sheets had bloodstains even after the second time they changed it. Our room and bathroom were dirty, prob because our roomates where constantly drunk. Alot of noise and music all day till around midnight. The walls are thin. Not a place for relaxing or sleeping."
Capsule Bali,Dark Edy,5.0,"Had a wonderful stay here. mango are sweetest person on reception. The hostel is very clean. Capsules are spacious and lockers are equally big. Good location, night life are near."
Capsule Bali,Dale Graham,4.0,Good clean rooms. Party hostel so good idea to join in rather than try to sleep.. good drinks promos and music stops at 11. Most people head out around 12 so does quiet down a bit then
Capsule Bali,David Tremblay,5.0,"Premier social/party hostel! If that's what you're looking for, you'll enjoy your stay. Has a movie viewing area with bean bags, rooftop, big bar with the world's best bartender, huge dining area, complete kitchen, great staff and then some. Do it"
Capsule Bali,C. Robson,4.0,"Comfy, clean bed - despite being in the overflow room. Plug socket, cosy little light to read a book with beforebed if 're not too drunk ;) Only thing they could improve, is the showers. Neil was great. Plenty of happy hours for drinks, and it's a nice little haven amongst a busy-ish part of town :). Super close to the Brazilian aussie bbq too ü§§"
Capsule Bali,Nurul Latifa,5.0,"If you're looking for something more than stay, this is it! The staffs soooo friendly and wonderful, the food is great, the bar is cheaper rhan most place outside! Overall I would highly recommend this hostel and would definitely stay again"
Capsule Bali,Megan Macpherson,1.0,"Beds felt damn and the room smelt of damp, our beds were right in front of the door and dont have curtains and the girls in our room kept leaving the door wide open so there was very little privacy. Breakfast wasn't included, it's a bit out of the way from the main city, and the bar got knocked down on our second last day so there was no atmosphere."
Capsule Bali,Dimas Gumelar,5.0,"I love this place because of the atmosphere of the hostel. Yes, this is a hostel! But the best one in Bali!! I missed Blue the puppy dog already, will be coming back again if I am in Seminyak for sure üòá"
Capsule Bali,ngurah agus,5.0,"so far, best hostel i've stayed around asia. Easily to find around Seminyak area, close away to the pub named lafavela, 15 minutes away beach, Shopping mall and all you need can be provided by reception. I have to say this place recommended. I love the atmosphere,staff hospitality, food also drink are really tasty and cheap. Honestly i missed the pizza haha. Definitely come back to Capsule soon"

Capsule Bali,ÌÅ¨Î¶¨ÎßùLEECREAM,2.0,*Î≤†ÎìúÎ≤ÑÍ∑∏Ïùò Îì±Ïû•* Staff mark (I‚Äôm not sure) was super kind. We were talking about some episodes of culture etc. but the fact is there was one insect on my bed looked like bed bug but i still don‚Äôt know it was bed bug cuz i saw it first time in my life. I tried to compare with youtube for checking how it look like. It looked like 95% bed bug. Anyway i got refund rest of day. Staff mark kept saying sorry to me. P.s. really party hostel. Some people shout til 5am.

Capsule Bali,Raphael Hedjasie,3.0,Capsules are really nice! The problem is more over that it can be very noisy due to a lot of party tourists. Also no breakfast included. Staff is helpful but still u wouldn't give more than 3 stars
Capsule Bali,Helen Stewart-Koster,5.0,Great spot if you‚Äôre up for a party vibe but don‚Äôt expect any early nights! Easy access to some of the best clubs in Bali and loads of events.
Capsule Bali,Jasmine Eytle,5.0,came on my own and the people staying here and the people running the hostel are very friendly ! Defiantly a hostel if you want to go out and party but can still chill out! Defiantly recommend !!!
Capsule Bali,Kelli Buzzini,1.0,My friend and I felt very unsafe the whole stay and the hostel did nothing when we complained and even made it impossible for us to review on Hostelworld. Do not stay here if you value your safety especially as a female traveler.
Capsule Bali,Beszir Vandyk Gorouachi,5.0,"One of the best places to stay in Bali, Hotel services and Hostel price, with a big swimming pool and bar with a nice bartenders ready to serve you the best drinks with a happy hour deals, they also have a restaurant so this place has everything you need, I would recommend this place to all travelers looking for spending a good time and meeting a friendly people as well as getting wild..."

Casa d'Ladera,Dini Dwi Damayanti,5.0,I stayed here for several times I stayed in a unique room with specialized car parking space just below the room. With a cheap price you also get breakfast for two. The breakfast was nice the staff was really helpful. Its pretty quiet hotel. They also sell some snacks inside the room. The room is clean but it has old-fashioned style. The cheapest room even had an old TV inside. The bathroom was quite small but it was nice they had water heater.
Casa d'Ladera,Rianthie Hanazk,4.0,"The room is quite simple. Affordable price. I took two deluxe rooms. No car garage. Room 202 and 205. It has refrigerator, AC, water heater. The breakfast is simple too, but it is nice. No complaint about it. The wifi is only accessible in lobby / restaurant area. It is nice hotel but unfortunately not really in good maintenance. The room has no coffe maker."

Casa d'Ladera,Muthia Triani,5.0,"Smart budgeted hotel with a complete breakfast.Deluxe room has each their very own car park, cost only rp 200-300k.Standart room is also ok, cheap... But, actually its minuses only on the old furnitures, cost about rp 200k"
Casa d'Ladera,Yasir Muhammad,5.0,"I've been stay here for a night. This is defenitely on top of the list in terms of budget hotel. The food is good when it comes to its reasonable price. If you are lucky enough, you can get a room with private garage.The location is also great since it's located on Lembang main road."
Casa d'Ladera,Faizah,4.0,"Located in very easy-spotted spot, just around Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI). For a budget hotel, this is definitely the right choice! I doubt it in the beginning, how could one star hotel be comfortable? Lol this is my friend's choice after all. Turned out with only with 200-250k you got a clean and comfortable room (with double bed) PLUS breakfast!! No wifi tho, hehe. But it's easy to visit tourist destinations from here."
Casa d'Ladera,Ade Rahmat,2.0,"No recommend, high cost on weekends.. don't try"

When I entered the room, it was a bit horror, the lights weren't bright, the mattress was dirty, the chairs and the bathroom were also horror, the towels were like black footcloths, I couldn't use them, the wadu for the facilities was really bad, the soap didn't have a telephone, it didn't work I wanted to call, I had to go to the lobby, strangely, the hotel didn't provide cooking I check my toothbrush at any hotel, even the price is cheaper than this, more clean, complete facilities, fighting isn't worth it, I don't recommend it just once.

Untuk tv dan ac saya malas mencoba krn sudah tidak mood jadi tidak tau berfungsi apa tidak. Waktu itu saya nginap peak season via aplikasi.

Dan ternyata jam 2 lewat, OB baru datang utk clean up kamar. Stlh pandemi bukannya meningkatkan pelayanan untuk menarik customer, malah memberikan pelayanan yg mengecewakan. Kondisi kamar bersih.

Casa d'Ladera,Ocha Wuisan,2.0,"(Translated by Google) Starting from looking for an impromptu hotel, get this hotel. From the outside the building looks nice, antique and unique. Finally tried to go straight to showing the room, after knowing what type I wanted to book, I immediately booked via trvlka, before leaving the hotel, I made a note to the receptionist for the room, asking for help to make sure the bedsheets, towels, linens, etc. were really clean, because what I saw when showing the linen and the bed sheet is dirty. D-day, my mother and sister checked in first. Got room number 202-203 (connecting door) and I'm at 206 My mother said I couldn't get a water heater for drinking. Ok, I'll look for it myself in borma. Here are some things that should be noted by the hotel: 1. All the bed sheets in the room that I booked were dirty, shabby 2. Lighting is very minimal 3. Smelly towels in all rooms 4. The soap dispenser does not work in all rooms 5. Room 206, just before I entered at the entrance there were lots of bottled trash, Inside, in the trash can, there was already trash left by previous guests, maybe yes, as well as in the trash can in the bathroom. 6. There are lots of hair sinks or water holes that have been there from the start. 7. Among the bed sheets in my room, there are lots of food containers that have dried up and look like that, so I doubt how long the bed sheet hasn't been replaced or how long has the room actually been used? 8. The room is sooooo dirty 9. If you can't borrow iron, you have to bring it, guys. Lastly, the morning of the last day before checking out I asked the fo if there were still rooms? Because my plan is to extend. Fo said there was no empty room because it was fully booked. But when I wanted to take my ID card, I heard that I was selling rooms to prospective new guests, the price offered was more expensive than what I bought on trvlk, I was surprised that I didn't have a room because it was fully booked but new guests can sell rooms Does that mean you accidentally drive Alus away? Hehehe. last (Original) Berawal cari hotel dadakan dapetlah hotel ini . Dari luar bangunan nya terlihat bagus, antik dan unik. Akhirnya nyoba dtg langsung untuk showing kamar, setelah tau tipe apa yg mau di book langsung book lewat trvlka, sebelum pergi dr hotel udah note ke mba resepsionis untuk kamarnya minta tolong di pastikan bedsheed handuk linen dll bener2 bersih, karna yg saya liat saat showing linen dan bed sheetnya kotor. Hari H, ibu saya dan kakak cek in duluan. Dapet kamar nomer 202-203 ( connecting door ) dan saya di 206 Kata ibu saya gak dapet pemanas air utk buat minum. Ok saya cari sendiri di borma. Berikut beberapa hal yang harus di note oleh pihak hotel : 1. Semua bed sheet di kamar yg saya book kotor lusuh 2. Penerangan sangat minim 3. Handuk bau di semua kamar 4. Dispenser sabun tidak berfungsi disemua kamar 5. Kamar 206, sesaat sebelum saya masuk di pintu masuk aja bnyk sampah botol2, Di dalem kmr di tong sampah sudah ada sampah sisa tamu sebelumnya mungkin ya, begitupun di tong sampah kmr mandi. 6. Sink atau lubang air bnyk bgt rambut yg sejak awal masuk udh ada. 7. Di antara bed seet kamar saya bnyk bekas makanan makanan yg udh sampe kering nyempil gitu jadi ragu nih bedsheet ga di ganti brp lama atau kamar sebenernya uh gakepake berapa lama? 8. Kamar kotor sekaliiiii 9. Gabisa setrika utk pinjem kudu bawa sndr kali ya guys. Terakhir, pagi harinya dihari terahir sebelum cek out saya tanya ke fo apakah masi ada kamar? Karna rencana nya saya mau extend. Fo bilang gada kamar kosong karna full booked. Tapi pas saya mau ambil ktp, saya denger fo lg jualan kamar ke calon tamu baru harga yg di tawarin emng lbh pricey diatas yg saya beli di trvlk sih, kaget aja ke saya blg udh gada kamr karna full booked tapi ke tamu baru bisa jualan kamar berarti secara ga sengaja ngusir alus ya? Hehehe. Terahir"
Casa d'Ladera,Robita Annisa,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Hotel with classic style on the outskirts of UPI Setiabudhi. Super very different concept. There are regular rooms and there are 2 floors (1st floor is for a car garage). The mattress is soft. The AC is old but still functioning properly, even with the fridge. The TV is small but the shows are better than other hotels where the TV is big but the shows are full of ants. Hahaha... Then, the big window can be opened. So feel really at home. It's a concept I really like. ‚ù§Ô∏è But, unfortunately the bathroom door can't be locked, there's no table tissue, you also have to ask the receptionist for toilet paper first, and the dressing table is without a chair. Hopefully in the future it can be even better. The problem is I really want to recommend this hotel. Very good service. The waiters are friendly. Bandung really. (Original) Hotel dengan gaya klasik di pinggiran UPI Setiabudhi. Super beda banget konsepnya. Ada kamar yang biasa dan ada yang 2 lantai (lantai 1 buat garasi mobil). Kasurnya empuk. AC-nya udah tua tapi masih berfungsi dengan baik, pun dengan fridge-nya. TV-nya kecil tapi tayangannya lebih baik daripada hotel lain yang TV-nye gede tapi tayangannya isinya semut semua. Wkwkwk... Kemudian, jendela besarnya bisa dibuka. Jadi berasa di rumah banget. Sungguh konsep yang sangat aku suka. ‚ù§Ô∏è Tapi, sayangnya pintu kamar mandinya gak bisa dikunci, gak ada tisu meja, tisu toilet juga harus minta dulu ke resepsionis, dan meja riasnya tanpa kursi. Semoga ke depannya bisa lebih baik lagi. Soalnya aku mau rekomendasi banget hotel ini. Pelayanan sangat baik. Pelayannya ramah. Bandung banget."

The rooms in this hotel are more like dormitories, eh, what's the name of tea, I don't know. I stayed here for a day, so I extended it for another day, so in total I stayed here for two days. But even though I like the hotel, for some reason I don't dare to be told to sleep at night alone, so I always bring a friend to accompany me to sleep at night hehe, luckily my friend is kind and wants to accompany me to sleep there. This hotel makes you feel like you're in an ancient European complex, it's really funny, really, you have to go if you dare but WKWK. In this hotel, but no toothbrush, there is only soap, the bathroom curtain is dirty at the bottom, there is no bathroom tissue, the tissue usually runs out, the TV channel only has one channel, the phone is also weird, it's useless, so if something goes wrong still have to go directly to the receptionist. But the good thing about this hotel is that if you order food online, you will be able to deliver it to the front door, wow, and here there is a play area for children too, hehe, it's really funny. (Original) Ini hotel tua yang buat aku langsu g tertarik pas pertama kali liat di agod*a, cantik banget, nuansa tuanya dapet tapi bagus juga. Kamar di hotel ini lebih mirip ke asrama ga si, eh apa si namanya teh, gatau. Aku stay disini yg tadinya mau sehari jadi extend lagi sehari, jadi total aku stay disini dua hari. Tapi walaupun aku suka sama hotelnya, entah kenapa aku ga berani kalo disuruh tidur malam malam sendiri, jadi aku selalu bawa temen buat nemenin aku bobo malam hehe, untungnya temen aku pada baik dan mau nemenin aku bobo disana. Di hotel ini bikin kalian berasa di kompleks eropa jaman dulu, lucu banget pokoknya mah, wajib kalian datangi si kalo berani tapi WKWK. Di hotel ini tapi ga dikasih sikat gigi, cuma ada sabun, korden kamar mandinya kotor di bagian bawah, tisu kamar mandi gaada, tisu biasanya juga abis, channel tv cuma ada satu saluran, teleponnya juga aneh kek ga berguna gitu jadi kalo ada apa apa tetep harus langsung ke resepsionis. Tapi enaknya di hotel ini tu kalo kalian pesen makanan lewat online gitu bakal bisa dianter sampe depan pintu wkwkw, dan disini ada tempat bermain buat anak anak juga loh hehe, lucu deh pokoknya."

They are promoting spotless linens though my linens are full of spots and had to ask the staff to replace the pillows as the inner pillows are already yellowing due to stains and it so old plus it has a odd smell. The wifi is decent no issue. The breakfast was good enough, paid extra for it. The room though is quite dirty specially the toilet door.

RedDoorz Plus near Isola UPI,Lajibira,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Order a room at a price of 150k via pegipegi, get a room size of about 3x4 m, pretty clean, neat, smells good with the bathroom inside (1x1 m), but after the bathroom is used it smells a little bit, maybe the ventilation is too small or is it better if you add an exhaust fan . The toiletries provided are only towels, toothbrushes & toothpaste ... no soap & shampoo. The floor is a bit sticky (whether it's been mopped or not).. the bathroom mat doesn't seem to have been replaced because it's a little wet. The TV can't be used... The hotel staff is very friendly. The room is not airtight because the sounds from outside are very audible. Overall it's okay according to the price because it's quite comfortable :) (Original) Order kamar dengan harga 150k an via pegipegi, dapet ukuran kamar sekitar 3x4 m , lumayan bersih, rapi, wangi dengan kamar mandi didalam (1x1 m), tapi setelah kamar mandi digunakan agak sedikit bau, mungkin terlalu kecil ventilasinya atau baikny siy ditambah exhaust fan. Peralatan mandi yang disediakan hanya handuk, sikat gigi, & odol .. tanpa sabun & shampoo. Lantai agak lengket (entah sudah dipel atau belum).. keset kamar mandi sepertinya belum diganti soalnya sedikit basah. Untuk tivinya tidak bisa digunakan.. Petugas hotelnya sangat ramah. Ruangan kamar tidak kedap udara karena suara2 dari luar sangat terdengar. Overall oke lah sesuai harga karena cukup nyaman :)"
RedDoorz Plus near Isola UPI,annisa dianggit,4.0,"(Translated by Google) Strategic location, a short way out, many selling food. Close to UPI campus. The room is spacious, there is hot water, the air conditioner is cold but it doesn't turn on, it's already cold hehe. The floor is very cold. There is a hanging cupboard, dressing table, mukena, towels, toiletries, drinking water and trash cans are provided. But the room is not soundproof, so if the next door neighbor turns on the tv but there is no signal it sounds really noisy. The receptionist in my opinion is less responsive, a little indifferent at checkin. Did not deliver to the room like the previous reddoorz. And downstairs the smell of cigarettes is very very wow. (Original) Lokasi strategis, jalan keluar sebentar banyak yg jual makanan2. Deket kampus UPI. Kamarnya luas, ada air panasnya, acnya dingin tp gak dinyalain juga udah dingin hehe. Lantainya dingin banget. Ada lemari gantung, meja kursi rias, disediain mukena, handuk, alat mandi, air minum dan tempat sampah. Tapi kamarnya tidak kedap suara, jadi kalo tetangga sebelah nyalain tv tp gak ada signal itu kedengeran berisik banget. Resepsionis nya menurut saya kurang tanggap sedikit cuek saat checkin. Tidak mengantar sampai kamar seperti reddoorz yg sebelumnya. Dan di lantai bawah itu bau rokoknya sangat sangat wow."

The location is very strategic, many sellers of typical Bandung food and also close to places selling souvenirs. For room facilities, it is a decent category, clean, there are towels and toiletries. It's just that the bathroom is too narrow and there is no exhouse so the smell can be smelled in the room Yesterday I arrived at the hotel at around 10 pm, the atmosphere was very quiet and it took quite a while to call the guest house guard (no one was on standby), as well as when I wanted to check out in the morning.

The rooms here all use wood, so it's not soundproof, actually if it's not located in DT the rooms are a bit scary maybe because it's been a long time, the sheets and bed covers are worn out (mbladus, lol) But it doesn't matter, my family and I are comfortable...

Kamar2 disini semuanya menggunakan kayu, sehingga tidak kedap suara, sesungguhnya jika bukan berlokasi di DT kamarnya agak seram mgkn karena sudah lama ya, seprei dan bedcovernya pun sudah lusuh (mbladus,lol) Tp tak masalah, sy dan keluarga nyaman nyaman saja...

With that rate, if you compare it with other hotels, there are still many better ones. 5. What doesn't have medicine is the atmosphere which is nostalgic, cool. Suggestion : 1. Invest in ceramic replacement and bathroom facilities. 2. Exterminate cockroaches and insects using pest control 3. Clear out the plants in the area behind the window/near the toilet. Replace with cheap ceramics and a vertical garden 4. the awning hall is being replaced and repaired which is leaking. 5. added a small slide for toddlers 6. wash the 1st & 2nd floor carpets, wash the curtains and vitrases using the cleaning service dt. 7.
